Hello, Again, i think you have rooted your device, if not, the most of content is not avalilale, and it's cannot used without rooting phone, sorry



Lucky Patcher! [ReVanced flashbacks (_soon!_)]

this is patcher, modificator for apps and even cheats for you!

here's my setup to use the full power of Phone!



Used content:

Lucky Patcher - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NgoND19W2WfF1QY1R92JqjcNsPBJwkxG/view?usp=share_link (Safe Version, Self Used)


Installation:

after downloading file, uhh, the Play Protect will block that ._. (_) this is not really virus, trust me, press "more" and then "install (not safe)"


Using:

Grant Lucky Patcher every possible permission and root access, the setup is complete


Addons:

click "toolbox", "Patches to Android" and click every thing what can be flagged, use the Magisk module option, reboot

do the same steps again, but now without patching you should press "run test"

if all lines are green (no red lines) then congrats, you can install lower version on newer version

//

Use Play Morket, in not really right way

click "toolbox", "Install Modded Google PLay Store", use latest version, wait, reboot, add widget "inapp emulation" to toggle between Legal and Illegal modes

buy what you need lmao (you cant download apps what cost money, that's impossible)

that's all im using!
